# Qantas Code Challenge

## Tech Stack

- Next.js – For building the React-based frontend
- React – Component-based UI development
- TypeScript – Type safety and improved development experience
- Styled-Components – For styling components with CSS-in-JS
- Context API – For state management
- Jest – For testing

## Setup & Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## What I Implemented

- **Atomic Design**: Applied atomic design principles to ensure reusability of components.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Isolated business logic from UI by utilizing utility functions and custom React hooks.
- **Global State Management**: Used Context API to manage global state efficiently.
- **Testing Strategy**: Used Jest and React Testing Library to have 100% test coverage for UI and business logic.
- **CSS-in-JS Approach**: Chose Styled-Components for styling within the Next.js application.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized the UI to be mobile friendly.

unsplash.it is redundant thus I switched the image source to [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos)

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, execute:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Areas for Improvement

While the core functionality is implemented, there is room for further enhancements:

- Using tokens for color & spacing variables to improve maintainability
- Implementing loading and error handling
- Extracting micro-components (e.g., a reusable Link component)
- Improving accessibility to ensure a more inclusive user experience

## Closing Notes

I focused on delivering a bug-free experience while ensuring the UI closely matches the design, with particular attention to improving test coverage.

I appreciate the opportunity to work on this challenge and look forward to hearing back from the team.

Thank you!
